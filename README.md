# Internet of Data (IoD)

A **collaborative, open-source data-sharing protocol** designed to revolutionize how datasets are published, accessed, and maintained. IoD aims to be the “GitHub for Data,” where users can version, fork, clean, annotate, and merge datasets, all while preserving data provenance and enabling seamless collaboration.

## Vision and Motivation

### Why “Internet of Data”?

The world needs a **unified, transparent, and collaborative platform** to share and maintain datasets. Currently, data is scattered across different repositories, marketplaces, academic websites, or proprietary platforms. This fragmentation makes it hard for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to:

- Discover high-quality datasets  
- Validate and version datasets effectively  
- Contribute improvements (cleaning, labeling, etc.)  
- Ensure licensing and usage compliance  

**IoD** aims to solve these issues by providing a **decentralized data-sharing layer** on top of the existing internet—much like how Git provides a version control layer on top of file systems.

### Our Mission

1. **Democratize Data Access**: Enable anyone to **discover and download** both free and paid datasets without friction.  
2. **Foster Collaboration**: Create a versioning system that allows “forking,” merging, and contribution back to the original dataset.  
3. **Improve Data Quality**: Encourage community-driven cleaning, annotation, and updates, ensuring data continually improves over time.  
4. **Streamline AI Development**: Make it easier for AI practitioners to train and deploy models using consistently versioned and well-documented datasets.

## Core Concepts

1. **Decentralized Hosting**  
   - Datasets aren’t centralized in a single server. Each dataset can be hosted by its owner on their own infrastructure or on distributed storage networks (e.g., IPFS).  
   - The IoD registry (or multiple registries) indexes metadata so users can discover data no matter where it physically resides.

2. **Version Control**  
   - Think of each dataset as a **repository** that can be cloned, branched, or forked.  
   - If a user cleans or updates a dataset, they can propose changes (like a “pull request”). Owners can choose to merge or reject those updates.

3. **Licensing and Payments**  
   - **Free and open** datasets might use licenses like CC-BY, CC0, or other open-data licenses.  
   - **Paid or proprietary** datasets can integrate with a payment gateway, allowing owners to monetize their data.  
   - A built-in mechanism ensures **license information** is attached to each dataset so that usage rights are clear.

4. **Search and Discovery**  
   - A **search protocol** (akin to a distributed “search engine”) allows users to find datasets by keywords, categories, domain, or usage licenses.  
   - Data owners can tag their repositories with relevant metadata to improve discoverability.

5. **Contributors and Roles**  
   - **Maintainers**: Dataset owners or delegated individuals responsible for approving merges.  
   - **Contributors**: Anyone who forks a dataset and proposes improvements or additions.  
   - **Moderators**: Community or appointed members who can flag inappropriate content, license violations, or other issues.

## Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level overview of the IoD system. Note that this project will evolve over time; the following outlines the **initial** design:

1. **Registry Layer**  
   - A registry service (or multiple replicated services) that keeps track of dataset metadata:  
     - Dataset name, description, tags  
     - Hosting location(s) (URLs, distributed addresses)  
     - License, version history, and maintainers  
     - Payment info for commercial datasets  
   - Implemented using a lightweight, decentralized database or a combination of a blockchain/IPFS approach and conventional DB for quick searches.

2. **Node Layer (Reference Implementations)**  
   - Individual or organizational nodes host the actual datasets.  
   - A node runs open-source **IoD Node** software that:  
     - Registers its datasets with the registry layer  
     - Publishes changes, merges, or new branches  
     - Syncs or seeds data as needed

3. **Client and Web Portal**  
   - A user-friendly **web interface** (similar to GitHub) that:  
     - Allows searching of all indexed datasets  
     - Shows dataset version history, commits, merges, etc.  
     - Displays data previews, stats, and readme-like descriptions  
     - Enables direct “fork” or “pull request” style actions

4. **AI Integration**  
   - Optional modules or microservices that run AI-based processes:  
     - Automated data cleaning or labeling suggestions  
     - Natural language search (“Find me all open datasets about cat images with at least 10,000 samples.”)  
     - Recommendation engine for relevant datasets based on user’s profile or usage history

---

## Key Features

1. **Forkable Datasets**  
   - Users can “fork” a dataset to create their own branch for specialized cleaning, transformations, or labeling tasks.

2. **Pull Requests & Merges**  
   - Contributors propose changes to the original dataset maintainers. Mergers are trackable, ensuring transparency and data provenance.

3. **Automated Data Validation**  
   - Hook scripts or AI-based services can run validations (schema checks, missing values detection, format standardization) before merges are approved.

4. **Data Lineage and Commit History**  
   - Every update has a commit log with a clear diff, so changes to each row or file are fully traceable.

5. **Searchable Metadata**  
   - Datasets are tagged with domain-specific keywords, licensing info, and references to relevant papers or projects.

6. **Community Moderation**  
   - A reporting system to flag illegal, copyrighted, or harmful datasets.  
   - Voting or reputation-based systems to promote high-quality data.

7. **Plugins for Payment**  
   - For premium datasets, an optional plugin handles subscriptions or one-time fees. The registry enforces license restrictions.

8. **In-Browser Preview**  
   - For tabular data, a quick data table preview.  
   - For images, thumbnails or small subsets displayed.  
   - For text, small excerpts to gauge content.

## FAQ

1. **Do I need huge servers to host a dataset?**  
   - Not necessarily. You can host on any server or cloud storage. The registry just needs your dataset’s metadata and access link.

2. **What if my data is private or sensitive?**  
   - Private or sensitive data should **not** be uploaded without proper anonymization or licensing. The IoD platform respects legal and ethical boundaries.

3. **How can I monetize my dataset?**  
   - Implement the paid plugin or integrate a payment gateway. The platform will enforce paywalls or subscription checks when users try to access the data.

4. **Is there a built-in AI for dataset cleaning?**  
   - We plan to offer optional AI modules. You can also plug in your own cleaning scripts or ML pipelines.

5. **Can I “take down” a dataset I originally shared?**  
   - Similar to open-source code, data forks may persist in the community. If you remove your dataset, your node won’t host it anymore. However, any existing forks in the community remain unless they also remove it.
